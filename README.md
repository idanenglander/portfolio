# Idan Englander's Technical Writing Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! Below you'll find a small set of topics I've written in the past, along with context for each topic.

Feel free to reach me through my personal email (idanenglander@gmail.com) for any and all inquiries, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/idan-englander/). 

## Samples

The following samples were written during my tenure with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). I was the sole writer for each topic, conducting independent research and consulting SMEs as necessary.

### Environments

A point of confusion for many Anaconda users is the concept and use of environments, yet for some time we lacked a centralized source of truth on the matter. I wanted to create a topic that defines environments and provides instructions on the most common actions users take when managing environments.

### Anaconda Code

Through a partnership with Microsoft Excel, Anaconda offers users the ability to run Python code directly within Excel workbooks. I worked with the PyExcel (Python in Excel) team to create a how-to guide on using the Anaconda Code in-app user interface.

As a technical writer, I often find myself operating as a QA engineer; in order to write clear and comprehensive documentation, I must thoroughly test our products to gain a working understanding of our offerings. For Anaconda Code (and all other products I've documented, for that matter), I provided the PMs and engineers with constructive feedback that affected the end product's look and functionality.
